## Supported OpenAI Parameters

Check this in code, [here](../completion/input.md#translated-openai-params)

```
"stream",
"stop",
"temperature",
"top_p",
"max_tokens",
"max_completion_tokens",
"tools",
"tool_choice",
"extra_headers",
"parallel_tool_calls",
"response_format",
"user",
"reasoning_effort",
```

:::info

**Notes:**
- Anthropic API fails requests when `max_tokens` are not passed. Due to this litellm passes `max_tokens=4096` when no `max_tokens` are passed.
- `response_format` uses Anthropic native structured outputs on Claude Sonnet 4.5+, Opus 4.5+ and Haiku 4.5. Older models such as Opus 4.1 fall back to a forced tool call (see [Structured Outputs](#structured-outputs) section)
- `reasoning_effort` is automatically mapped to `output_config={"effort": ...}` for Claude 4.6 and Opus 4.5 models (see [Effort Parameter](./anthropic_effort.md))

:::

## **Structured Outputs**

LiteLLM supports Anthropic's [structured outputs feature](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/structured-outputs) for Claude Sonnet 4.5 and later, Opus 4.5 and later, and Haiku 4.5. When you use `response_format` with these models, LiteLLM automatically:
- Adds the required `structured-outputs-2025-11-13` beta header
- Transforms OpenAI's `response_format` to Anthropic's `output_format` format

### Supported Models
Native structured outputs are used when the model has `supports_native_structured_output` set in the model cost map:
- Sonnet 4.5 and later (`claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-5`)
- Opus 4.5 and later (`claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-opus-5`, `claude-opus-5-5`)
- Haiku 4.5 (`claude-haiku-4-5`)

Claude Opus 4.1 and older models do not have this flag, so LiteLLM never sends `output_format` for them. It instead adds a `json_tool_call` tool built from your schema and forces the model to call it

### Example Usage

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="sdk" label="LiteLLM SDK">

```python
from litellm import completion

response = completion(
    model="{{anthropic}}",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    response_format={
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "capital_response",
            "strict": True,
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "country": {"type": "string"},
                    "capital": {"type": "string"}
                },
                "required": ["country", "capital"],
                "additionalProperties": False
            }
        }
    }
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
# Output: {"country": "France", "capital": "Paris"}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="proxy" label="LiteLLM Proxy">

1. Setup config.yaml

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: {{anthropic}}
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/{{anthropic}}
      api_key: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

2. Start proxy

```bash
litellm --config /path/to/config.yaml
```

3. Test it!

```bash
curl http://0.0.0.0:4000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "{{anthropic}}",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    "response_format": {
        "type": "json_schema",
        "json_schema": {
            "name": "capital_response",
            "strict": true,
            "schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "country": {"type": "string"},
                    "capital": {"type": "string"}

                "required": ["country", "capital"],
                "additionalProperties": false
            }
        }
    }
  }'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
When using structured outputs with supported models, LiteLLM automatically:
- Converts OpenAI's `response_format` to Anthropic's `output_format`
- Adds the `anthropic-beta: structured-outputs-2025-11-13` header

For models without native support, LiteLLM instead creates a `json_tool_call` tool with the schema and forces the model to use it
:::

## API Keys

```python
import os

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
# os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_BASE"] = "" # [OPTIONAL] or 'ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL'
# os.environ["LITELLM_ANTHROPIC_DISABLE_URL_SUFFIX"] = "true" # [OPTIONAL] Disable automatic URL suffix appending
```

:::tip[Azure Foundry Support]

Claude models are also available via Microsoft Azure Foundry. Use the `azure_ai/` prefix instead of `anthropic/` and configure Azure authentication. See the [Azure Anthropic documentation](../providers/azure/azure_anthropic) for details.

Example:
```python
response = completion(
    model="azure_ai/{{anthropic}}",
    api_base="https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic",
    api_key="your-azure-api-key",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}]
)
```

:::

### Custom API Base

When using a custom API base for Anthropic (e.g., a proxy or custom endpoint), LiteLLM automatically appends the appropriate suffix (`/v1/messages` or `/v1/complete`) to your base URL.

If your custom endpoint already includes the full path or doesn't follow Anthropic's standard URL structure, you can disable this automatic suffix appending:

```python
import os

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_BASE"] = "https://my-custom-endpoint.com/custom/path"
os.environ["LITELLM_ANTHROPIC_DISABLE_URL_SUFFIX"] = "true"  # Prevents automatic suffix
```

Without `LITELLM_ANTHROPIC_DISABLE_URL_SUFFIX`:
- Base URL `https://my-proxy.com` → `https://my-proxy.com/v1/messages`
- Base URL `https://my-proxy.com/api` → `https://my-proxy.com/api/v1/messages`

With `LITELLM_ANTHROPIC_DISABLE_URL_SUFFIX=true`:
- Base URL `https://my-proxy.com/custom/path` → `https://my-proxy.com/custom/path` (unchanged)

### Azure AI Foundry (Alternative Method)

:::tip[Recommended Method]
For full Azure support including Azure AD authentication, use the dedicated [Azure Anthropic provider](./azure/azure_anthropic) with `azure_ai/` prefix.
:::

As an alternative, you can use the `anthropic/` provider directly with your Azure endpoint since Azure exposes Claude using Anthropic's native API.

```python
from litellm import completion

response = completion(
    model="anthropic/{{anthropic}}",
    api_base="https://<your-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic",
    api_key="<your-azure-api-key>",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
)
print(response)
```

:::info
**Finding your Azure endpoint:** Go to Azure AI Foundry → Your deployment → Overview. Your base URL will be `https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic`
:::

## Workload Identity Federation

Anthropic supports workload identity federation, so a proxy can exchange an OIDC identity token it already holds for a short-lived `sk-ant-oat01` access token instead of storing a long-lived `sk-ant-` key. This is the Anthropic equivalent of what Vertex AI and Azure already do, and it suits deployments with a no-static-secrets policy.

LiteLLM mints and caches the access token for you. Configure the federation identifiers plus one identity source, and every route that reaches Anthropic uses the minted token: chat completions, `/v1/messages`, files, batches, skills, passthrough, token counting and model discovery.

### Federation identifiers

These come from the federation rule you create in the Anthropic Console, and they are the same whichever identity source you pick:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `anthropic_federation_rule_id` | The `fdrl_...` id of the federation rule |
| `anthropic_organization_id` | Your Anthropic organization UUID |
| `anthropic_service_account_id` | The `svac_...` service account the rule maps to |
| `anthropic_federation_workspace_id` | Required when the rule is enabled in more than one workspace; scopes the minted token to that workspace |

Anthropic's own reference calls the last one `workspace_id`, but federation reads it from `ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_WORKSPACE_ID`, not `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID`. The shorter name already belongs to the Bedrock Claude platform provider, where it picks the workspace a Bedrock call is billed to, so federation takes the longer one and leaves that behavior alone. Setting `ANTHROPIC_WORKSPACE_ID` does nothing for federation

### Static keys take precedence

A static credential outranks federation everywhere in the Anthropic provider. If `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, every Anthropic route uses it and nothing is federated; `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` comes next, and federation is the last tier. This matches the Anthropic SDK's own ordering, and it applies to files, batches and model discovery as well as to chat.

So a deployment that is meant to be federated must not carry a static key. If one is set anyway, LiteLLM logs a warning naming the model whose federation is being shadowed. A blank or whitespace-only value counts as unset and falls through to federation

### Configuring by environment instead

Every field below can come from the environment rather than the deployment, which is what you want
when the same values apply proxy-wide. A value set on the deployment wins over the environment.

| Field | Environment variable |
| --- | --- |
| `anthropic_federation_rule_id` | `ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID` |
| `anthropic_organization_id` | `ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID` |
| `anthropic_service_account_id` | `ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| `anthropic_federation_workspace_id` | `ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_WORKSPACE_ID` |
| `anthropic_identity_source` | `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_SOURCE` |
| `anthropic_identity_token_file` | `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE` |
| `anthropic_identity_token` | `ANTHROPIC_IDENTITY_TOKEN` |

### Identity sources

There are four ways to supply the OIDC assertion. Two need no `anthropic_identity_source` at all, and two are selected with it.

#### Token file (default)

Reads an assertion a platform already projects onto disk, which is how Kubernetes service account tokens and most CI runners work. Set `anthropic_identity_token_file` and leave `anthropic_identity_source` unset. The path must sit under LiteLLM's OIDC file allowlist, which you extend with `LITELLM_OIDC_ALLOWED_CREDENTIAL_DIRS`. The file is re-read on each mint, so a rotated token is picked up without a restart.

```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: claude-sonnet-4-5
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
      anthropic_identity_token_file: /var/run/secrets/anthropic.com/token
      anthropic_federation_rule_id: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID
      anthropic_organization_id: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID
      anthropic_service_account_id: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID
```

#### Secret reference (default)

`anthropic_identity_token` takes an `oidc/` reference, not a raw token. Accepted forms are `oidc/env/VAR_NAME`, `oidc/file//absolute/path`, `oidc/github/<audience>`, and `oidc/google/<audience>`. Pasting a bare JWT is rejected, so export it and reference the variable instead.

```yaml
      anthropic_identity_token: oidc/env/MY_WORKLOAD_TOKEN
```

#### LiteLLM as the issuer

For deployments with no external IdP, LiteLLM signs the assertion itself with an ES256 (P-256) key. Set `anthropic_identity_source: internal_issuer` and point `anthropic_issuer_signing_key_ref` at the key rather than pasting it inline, so custody stays with your secret manager. `anthropic_issuer_ttl_seconds` defaults to 300 and cannot exceed 3600.

```yaml
credential_list:
  - credential_name: anthropic_wif
    credential_values:
      anthropic_identity_source: internal_issuer
      anthropic_issuer_url: https://litellm.example.com
      anthropic_issuer_subject: litellm-proxy
      anthropic_issuer_audience: https://api.anthropic.com
      anthropic_issuer_signing_key_ref: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_WIF_SIGNING_KEY
      anthropic_issuer_ttl_seconds: 300
      anthropic_federation_rule_id: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_FEDERATION_RULE_ID
      anthropic_organization_id: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_ORGANIZATION_ID
      anthropic_service_account_id: os.environ/ANTHROPIC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID
    credential_info:
      custom_llm_provider: anthropic

model_list:
  - model_name: claude-sonnet-4-5
    litellm_params:
      model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
      litellm_credential_name: anthropic_wif
```

Anthropic needs the matching public key to verify what LiteLLM signs. Export it from the proxy and register it as the **inline** issuer JWKS on your federation rule:

```shell
curl -s http://localhost:4000/credentials/anthropic_wif/jwks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_MASTER_KEY"
```

The endpoint is proxy-admin only and never exposes the private key, so paste the JSON it returns into the Anthropic Console rather than pointing Anthropic at the URL. A freshly registered JWKS takes about a minute before Anthropic accepts assertions signed by it.

#### Keycloak

For shops that already run Keycloak as the workload IdP, LiteLLM fetches the assertion with an OAuth client credentials grant. Set `anthropic_identity_source: keycloak` plus:

```yaml
      anthropic_keycloak_token_url: https://keycloak.example.com/realms/prod/protocol/openid-connect/token
      anthropic_keycloak_client_id: litellm-proxy
      anthropic_keycloak_auth_method: client_secret_basic  # or client_secret_post
      anthropic_keycloak_client_secret_ref: os.environ/KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET
      anthropic_keycloak_scope: anthropic-federation
```

Mixing fields across variants is rejected rather than silently ignored, so a config that names `internal_issuer` while carrying Keycloak fields fails at startup instead of quietly falling back.

### Setting it up in the UI

The Admin UI does not offer these fields yet, so configure federation through the proxy config or the environment as shown above. A follow-up adds them to the LLM Credentials flow.

### Token lifetime and refresh

LiteLLM caches the minted access token per deployment and refreshes it in the background before it expires, so a request rarely waits on an exchange. Refresh is two-tier: an advisory refresh at half the token's lifetime that happens in the background while the old token keeps serving, and a mandatory one at an eighth of the lifetime that blocks. Concurrent requests for the same deployment share a single in-flight exchange rather than each minting their own, so the number of exchanges does not scale with traffic.

Workers on the same host share the minted token through a small on-disk cache under the temp directory, readable only by the proxy's user, so a proxy running several uvicorn workers exchanges each assertion once rather than once per worker. `LITELLM_TOKEN_EXCHANGE_CACHE_DIR` moves that cache, and setting it to an empty string turns it off so every process mints on its own. Replicas on different hosts always mint their own token.

Anthropic accepts each assertion once: a second exchange of the same JWT is denied with the opaque 401 and shows up as `jti_reused` in the rule's authentication history. That is fine for the internal issuer and Keycloak sources, which mint a fresh assertion for every exchange, but a token file or `oidc/env/` value has to rotate faster than the rule's `token_lifetime_seconds`, or the first refresh after the minted token expires fails until a new assertion shows up. Kubernetes rotates a projected service account token once 80% of its `expirationSeconds` has passed, so keep the rule's token lifetime at or above that rotation period; the defaults (a one hour projected token and a one hour rule lifetime) line up.

### Who can configure it

Only a proxy admin can create or change a deployment that uses workload identity federation. A team admin who otherwise manages a team-scoped deployment gets a 403, and that holds however the change is expressed: setting a federation field directly, attaching a credential that carries one by name, or changing `api_base` on a deployment that is already federated. The last one matters because `api_base` decides where the signed assertion is sent and where the minted token is presented, so it is part of the federation configuration even though it is not a federation field.

The same rule covers the stored fallback lists on a key or team. A fallback target cannot carry a federation field, since those are merged over the deployment's own configuration when a failover happens.

Teams keep normal access to a federated deployment. Only editing it moves to the proxy admin.

### Restricting where assertions are sent

The exchange only talks to `api.anthropic.com`. If you front Anthropic with a gateway, list its hostname in `LITELLM_ANTHROPIC_WIF_ALLOWED_HOSTS` (comma separated) so the signed assertion is allowed to reach it.

```shell
export LITELLM_ANTHROPIC_WIF_ALLOWED_HOSTS="anthropic.gateway.internal"
```

An entry may name a port, in which case only that port is trusted and another process on the same host is not. An entry without a port trusts every port on that host.

```shell
export LITELLM_ANTHROPIC_WIF_ALLOWED_HOSTS="anthropic.gateway.internal:8443"
```

The list is read from the environment only. It is never taken from a model or credential API, because `api_base` decides both where the assertion is sent and where the minted token is presented

### Monitoring

Token health is emitted through the standard service-logging path: `prometheus_system` sends it to Prometheus and `otel` sends it to OpenTelemetry, using the exporter settings from the [OpenTelemetry docs](../observability/opentelemetry_integration). The services are `anthropic_wif` for the exchange itself and `anthropic_wif_cache` for cache hits and misses, giving you mint counts, mint latency, and failures broken out by cause. Enable them with:

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  service_callback: ["prometheus_system", "otel"]
```

## Usage

```python
import os
from litellm import completion

# set env - [OPTIONAL] replace with your anthropic key
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey! how's it going?"}]
response = completion(model="{{anthropic_large}}", messages=messages)
print(response)
```


## Usage - Streaming
Just set `stream=True` when calling completion.

```python
import os
from litellm import completion

# set env
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Hey! how's it going?"}]
response = completion(model="{{anthropic_large}}", messages=messages, stream=True)
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk["choices"][0]["delta"]["content"])  # same as openai format
```

## Usage with LiteLLM Proxy 

Here's how to call Anthropic with the LiteLLM Proxy Server

### 1. Save key in your environment

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### 2. Start the proxy

## **Prompt Caching**

Use Anthropic Prompt Caching


[Relevant Anthropic API Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching)

:::note

Here's what a sample Raw Request from LiteLLM for Anthropic Context Caching looks like: 

```bash
POST Request Sent from LiteLLM:
curl -X POST \
https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages \
-H 'accept: application/json' -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' -H 'content-type: application/json' -H 'x-api-key: sk-...' \
-d '{'model': '{{anthropic}}', [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "What are the key terms and conditions in this agreement?",
          "cache_control": {
            "type": "ephemeral"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Certainly! The key terms and conditions are the following: the contract is 1 year long for $10/mo"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "max_tokens": 10
}'
```

**Note:** Anthropic no longer requires the `anthropic-beta: prompt-caching-2024-07-31` header. Prompt caching now works automatically when you use `cache_control` in your messages.

### Caching - Continuing Multi-Turn Convo

In this example, we demonstrate how to use Prompt Caching in a multi-turn conversation.

The cache_control parameter is placed on the system message to designate it as part of the static prefix.

The conversation history (previous messages) is included in the messages array. The final turn is marked with cache-control, for continuing in followups. The second-to-last user message is marked for caching with the cache_control parameter, so that this checkpoint can read from the previous cache.

### Forcing Anthropic Tool Use

If you want Claude to use a specific tool to answer the user’s question

You can do this by specifying the tool in the `tool_choice` field like so:
```python
response = completion(
    model="anthropic/{{anthropic}}",
    messages=messages,
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice={"type": "tool", "name": "get_weather"},
)
```

### Disable Tool Calling

You can disable tool calling by setting the `tool_choice` to `"none"`.

### Context Management (Beta)

Anthropic’s [context editing](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/context-editing) API lets you automatically clear older tool results or thinking blocks. LiteLLM now forwards the native `context_management` payload when you call Anthropic models, and automatically attaches the required `context-management-2025-06-27` beta header.

```python
from litellm import completion

response = completion(
    model="anthropic/{{anthropic}}",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize the latest tool results"}],
    context_management={
        "edits": [
            {
                "type": "clear_tool_uses_20250919",
                "trigger": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 30000},
                "keep": {"type": "tool_uses", "value": 3},
                "clear_at_least": {"type": "input_tokens", "value": 5000},
                "exclude_tools": ["web_search"],
            }
        ]
    },
)

## Usage - Thinking / `reasoning_content`

LiteLLM translates OpenAI's `reasoning_effort` to Anthropic's `thinking` parameter. [Code](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/23051d89dd3611a81617d84277059cd88b2df511/litellm/llms/anthropic/chat/transformation.py#L298)

| reasoning_effort | thinking |
| ---------------- | -------- |
| "low"            | "budget_tokens": 1024 |
| "medium"         | "budget_tokens": 2048 |
| "high"           | "budget_tokens": 4096 |

:::note
`reasoning_effort` maps to Anthropic's [adaptive thinking](https: //docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking/adaptive-thinking) plus the `output_config.effort` parameter on Claude 4.6 and 4.7 models (including `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, etc. ), **not** `budget_tokens`. In particular, LiteLLM will inject the following into the underlying Anthropic request on the OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` route:

```json
{
  "thinking": {"type": "adaptive"},
  "output_config": {"effort": "<low|medium|high|xhigh|max>"}
}
```

This means **any value other than `"none"` for `reasoning_effort` will automatically turn thinking on for these models**, even though the OpenAI-compatible request body does not have a separate `thinking` field. This is intended to match Anthropic's own recommended usage: budget_tokens has been deprecated on 4.6 models and rejected entirely on Opus 4.7, where only adaptive is a supported thinking mode.

You can disable thinking either by omitting `reasoning_effort` entirely or setting it to `"none"`. LiteLLM will not send a `thinking` field in that case. You can still pass the native `thinking` parameter directly if you wish to explicitly control thinking with a fixed budget on prior models:

```python keep-model-ids
from litellm import completion

# Disable thinking on Claude 4.6/4.7
resp = completion(
    model="anthropic/claude-opus-4-7",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    reasoning_effort="none",  # no thinking field sent
)

# Explicit budget (pre-4.6 models; deprecated on 4.6, rejected on Opus 4.7)
resp = completion(
    model="anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}],
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 1024},
)
```

The Anthropic `/v1/messages` passthrough route is unaffected by this reasoning effort mapping. `thinking` is passed through unchanged.

## **Passing Extra Headers to Anthropic API**

Pass `extra_headers: dict` to `litellm.completion`

```python keep-model-ids
from litellm import completion
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What is Anthropic?"}]
response = completion(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", 
    messages=messages, 
    extra_headers={"anthropic-beta": "max-tokens-3-5-sonnet-2024-07-15"}
)
```

## Usage - "Assistant Pre-fill"

You can "put words in Claude's mouth" by including an `assistant` role message as the last item in the `messages` array.

:::info

The returned completion will _not_ include your "pre-fill" text, since it is part of the prompt itself. Make sure to prefix Claude's completion with your pre-fill.

:::

```python keep-model-ids
import os
from litellm import completion

# set env - [OPTIONAL] replace with your anthropic key
os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "How do you say 'Hello' in German? Return your answer as a JSON object, like this:\n\n{ \"Hello\": \"Hallo\" }"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "{"},
]
response = completion(model="claude-2.1", messages=messages)
print(response)
```

#### Example prompt sent to Claude

```

Human: How do you say 'Hello' in German? Return your answer as a JSON object, like this:

{ "Hello": "Hallo" }

Assistant: {
```

## Usage - "System" messages
If you're using Anthropic's Claude 2.1, `system` role messages are properly formatted for you.

```python keep-model-ids

from litellm import completion

# set env - [OPTIONAL] replace with your anthropic key

## Usage - PDF

Pass base64 encoded PDF files to Anthropic models using the `file` content type with a `file_data` field.

## Files API

Upload files once and reference them by `file_id` in multiple requests, with no need to re-upload content each time.

:::info
The `file_id` obtained from Anthropic only works with Anthropic Claude models. You cannot use it with other providers (OpenAI, Bedrock, etc.).
:::

- **Max file size:** 500 MB | **Total storage:** 100 GB per org
- **Pricing:** File API operations are free. File content used in Messages requests is priced as input tokens.

**Supported models by file type:**
- **Images:** All Claude 3+ models
- **PDFs:** All Claude 3.5+ models
- **Other file types** (for code execution): Claude 3.5 Haiku + all Claude 3.7+ models

### Quick Start

```python
import litellm
import os

os.environ["ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"] = "sk-ant-..."

# 1. Upload a file once
file = litellm.create_file(
    file=open("document.pdf", "rb"),
    purpose="messages",
    custom_llm_provider="anthropic",
)

# 2. Use file_id in messages (no re-upload needed)
response = litellm.completion(
    model="anthropic/{{anthropic}}",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Summarize this document"},
            {"type": "file", "file": {"file_id": file.id, "format": "application/pdf"}}
        ]
    }]
)
```

### File Operations

| Operation | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Upload | `litellm.create_file(file, purpose="messages", custom_llm_provider="anthropic")` |
| List | `litellm.file_list(custom_llm_provider="anthropic")` |
| Retrieve | `litellm.file_retrieve(file_id, custom_llm_provider="anthropic")` |
| Delete | `litellm.file_delete(file_id, custom_llm_provider="anthropic")` |
| Download | `litellm.file_content(file_id, custom_llm_provider="anthropic")` |

:::note
Download only works for files created by the [code execution tool](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/code-execution-tool), not uploaded files.
:::

### Supported Formats

| File Type | Format Value |
|-----------|-------------|
| PDF | `application/pdf` |
| Plain text | `text/plain` |
| JPEG | `image/jpeg` |
| PNG | `image/png` |
| GIF | `image/gif` |
| WebP | `image/webp` |

### Using Images

```python
# Upload image
image = litellm.create_file(
    file=open("photo.jpg", "rb"),
    purpose="messages",
    custom_llm_provider="anthropic",
)

# Use in message
response = litellm.completion(
    model="anthropic/{{anthropic}}",
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
            {"type": "file", "file": {"file_id": image.id, "format": "image/jpeg"}}
        ]
    }]
)
```

## Usage - passing 'user_id' to Anthropic

LiteLLM translates the OpenAI `user` param to Anthropic's `metadata[user_id]` param.
