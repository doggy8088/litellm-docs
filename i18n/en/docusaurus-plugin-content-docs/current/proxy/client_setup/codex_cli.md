# Connect Codex CLI to LiteLLM

[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) reads all of its configuration from `~/.codex/config.toml`. You define LiteLLM as a custom model provider there and register the [MCP gateway](../../mcp.md) in the same file. This is the same config the [Codex surface inside ChatGPT Desktop](./codex_chatgpt_desktop.md) uses, so setting it up once covers both.

## Quick reference

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Config file | `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| `base_url` | `<LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL>/v1` (e.g. `http://localhost:4000/v1`) |
| Provider key | Your LiteLLM [virtual key](../virtual_keys.md), read from the env var named in `env_key`, or [`lite auth print-token`](#sign-in-with-litellm-sso) |
| `model_catalog_url` | `<LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL>/v1/models`, plus `api_key_model_discovery = true` under `[features]` |
| MCP endpoint | `<LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL>/<server_name>/mcp` |
| MCP auth | The same virtual key, read from the env var named in `bearer_token_env_var` |

## LLM setup

### 1. Install Codex

```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
```

Or with the official installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://chatgpt.com/codex/install.sh | sh
```

### 2. Define LiteLLM as a model provider

Codex uses the OpenAI Responses API, which LiteLLM serves at `/v1/responses`. Add a provider block to `~/.codex/config.toml` and select it as the default. `env_key` names the environment variable Codex reads your virtual key from, so no secret is stored in the file:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
model = "{{anthropic}}"
model_provider = "litellm"

[model_providers.litellm]
name = "LiteLLM"
base_url = "http://localhost:4000/v1"
env_key = "LITELLM_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

Long agent turns can idle for minutes behind a gateway, so raise the stream timeout and retries if tasks are cut short:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
[model_providers.litellm]
stream_idle_timeout_ms = 7200000
stream_max_retries = 5
request_max_retries = 4
```

Export the key, then run Codex:

```bash
export LITELLM_API_KEY="sk-<your-virtual-key>"

codex
```

`model` can be any `model_name` from your LiteLLM config. Override it per run with `codex --model {{gemini_pro}}`. Until you complete [step 4](#model-catalog-and-service-tiers), Codex only knows the metadata of OpenAI's own models, so with a gateway name it prints `Model metadata for ... not found. Defaulting to fallback metadata` on the first request and its `/model` picker keeps showing Codex's built-in models; requests still go through. Step 4 fetches the catalog from the gateway, and [Model metadata for custom aliases](#model-metadata-for-custom-aliases) covers a local catalog file instead

Codex shows the model in its startup header and routes the task through the gateway. Here Codex 0.154 is answering through a local gateway:

<Image img={require('../../../img/client_setup/codex_cli_llm.png')} />

### 3. Verify

Ask Codex to make a small change, then check the Admin UI under **Logs** or **Usage**; the request appears under `/v1/responses`, attributed to your virtual key and the model you selected.

The row carries no end user yet, since Codex has no setting that puts one in the request body. To attribute each request to a developer, customer, or project instead, add a LiteLLM tracking header to the provider block with `http_headers` or `env_http_headers`; see [Codex CLI granular cost tracking](../../tutorials/codex_customer_tracking.md).

### 4. Let Codex list the gateway's models and service tiers {#model-catalog-and-service-tiers}

For an OpenAI deployment with UI screenshots, configuration, and request examples, see [Fast & Ultrafast mode](../../providers/openai/ultrafast.md). The guide also explains when to set a default `service_tier` and when to let Codex choose it per request.

Codex never asks a custom provider which models it serves unless you tell it to, so its `/model` picker shows Codex's built-in OpenAI models and a gateway-only name such as `my-coding-model` never appears in it. Codex CLI 0.159 or newer can fetch the catalog from the gateway instead. Two settings are needed together: `model_catalog_url` on the provider block, pointed at `<LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL>/v1/models`, and the `api_key_model_discovery` feature under `[features]`. Either one alone changes nothing, so `codex --enable api_key_model_discovery` without the URL never calls the gateway. `suppress_unstable_features_warning = true` silences the startup warning that enabling the feature adds

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
[features]
api_key_model_discovery = true
suppress_unstable_features_warning = true

[model_providers.litellm]
name = "LiteLLM"
base_url = "http://localhost:4000/v1"
model_catalog_url = "http://localhost:4000/v1/models"
env_key = "LITELLM_API_KEY"
wire_api = "responses"
```

On startup Codex calls `GET /v1/models?client_version=<its version>` with your virtual key, and the gateway answers in Codex's own catalog format. The `/model` picker then lists your gateway's chat models in `model_list` order, named by `model_info.display_name` when you set one and by the `model_name` otherwise. Wildcard entries such as `openai/*` and models that are not chat models (embeddings, for example) are left out. A model Codex already knows, by its `model_name` or by the upstream model in `litellm_params.model`, keeps Codex's own metadata (reasoning levels, prompt, tool support) under your name, so `my-coding-model` backed by `openai/gpt-6.1-sol` gets the same reasoning levels and prompt as Codex's own `gpt-6.1-sol`. Any other model gets the same fallback metadata Codex uses for `codex -m <unknown name>`, with the gateway's `max_input_tokens` as its context window, so it works but offers no reasoning-effort choices

`model_info.service_tiers` sets the service tiers Codex offers for a model, and each tier becomes a slash command. The tier id `ultrafast` becomes `/ultrafast`; toggling it makes Codex send `service_tier: "ultrafast"` on every request, which the gateway forwards upstream and prices with the tier's cost fields (`input_cost_per_token_ultrafast` and the other `*_ultrafast` fields) when the model's pricing entry carries them. Each entry is a tier id string or an object with `id`, `name`, and `description`. A plain string gets the id capitalized as its name and `Sends service_tier=<id> upstream` as its description, and Codex lowercases the name to form the command. A string naming a tier Codex itself ships for that model, such as `priority`, keeps Codex's own name and description, so it still shows as `/fast`. An object sets the name and the description Codex shows in the command popup. The configured list replaces the tiers Codex ships for that model, so list `priority` as well to keep `/fast` next to a new tier. An empty list removes every tier, and leaving `service_tiers` unset keeps Codex's stock tiers for a model it knows (a model it does not know has none)

```yaml title="config.yaml"
model_list:
  - model_name: gpt-6-astra
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/gpt-6-astra
      api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
    model_info:
      service_tiers: ["priority", "ultrafast"]
  - model_name: my-coding-model
    litellm_params:
      model: openai/gpt-6-astra
      api_key: os.environ/OPENAI_API_KEY
    model_info:
      service_tiers:
        - id: ultrafast
          name: Ultrafast
          description: Fastest responses, higher cost
```

Only list tiers supported by the upstream model and your provider account. Both deployments above use GPT-6 Astra; see [Fast and Ultrafast supported models](../../providers/openai/ultrafast.md#supported-models-and-availability) before advertising a tier on another model.

The same `model_info` works for a model added through the Admin UI or `POST /model/new`. Codex caches the catalog for five minutes in `models_cache.json` under its home directory, so a model added to the gateway shows up in `/model` on a launch after that cache lapses. An invalid `service_tiers` value (not a list, an empty id, an unknown object key) offers no tier for that model, Codex's built-in ones included, and the gateway logs one warning naming it; the rest of the listing is unaffected

When several deployments share one `model_name`, a request can route to any of them, so Codex is offered only the tiers every deployment of that name the key's team can route to lists, in the first deployment's order; another team's deployment of the name and a paused one are left out, as routing leaves them out, and a key with no team reads the deployments no team owns. The same deployments decide which upstream model Codex's own metadata comes from, so a team whose deployment of `my-coding-model` is backed by `openai/gpt-6.1-sol` gets that model's reasoning levels and prompt while a team whose deployment is backed by another model gets the fallback metadata. A routable deployment that leaves `service_tiers` unset, or sets an invalid value, therefore removes every tier for that name. Both cases log a warning naming the model, so set the same list on each deployment

Requests to `/v1/models` or `/models` without Codex's `client_version` query parameter keep the OpenAI response shape, so other clients see no change. Codex accepts a catalog of at most 1 MiB and silently keeps its built-in list when the body is larger, so the gateway keeps only the entries that fit: models that list a service tier are kept first, then the rest in `model_list` order, an entry too large for the bytes left is passed over while smaller ones after it are still kept, and the models left out are logged. Each entry is 20 to 65 KB, so roughly 20 to 45 models fit, and a model without a tier that was left out still works by name with Codex's fallback metadata. Put the models your Codex users need first in `model_list`
## Sign in with LiteLLM SSO

In place of a long-lived virtual key, Codex can ask the `lite` CLI for a token whenever it needs one. Each developer runs [`lite login --pkce`](../cli_sso.md) once, and requests are then attributed to their LiteLLM user and team

Replace `env_key` with an `auth` table in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
model_provider = "litellm"

[model_providers.litellm]
name = "LiteLLM"
base_url = "https://litellm.example.com/v1"
wire_api = "responses"

[model_providers.litellm.auth]
command = "/absolute/path/to/lite"
args = ["--base-url", "https://litellm.example.com", "auth", "print-token"]
timeout_ms = 30000
refresh_interval_ms = 300000
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/lite` with the absolute path returned by `which lite`. The `--base-url` value must exactly match the URL used for `lite login --pkce`; a token issued for `http://127.0.0.1:4000` is not returned for `http://localhost:4000`. `lite auth print-token` writes only the token to stdout and renews it with the refresh token stored by PKCE login. After `lite logout`, Codex receives 401 responses until you run `lite login --pkce` again

Codex rejects a provider that sets both `auth` and `env_key` with `provider auth cannot be combined with env_key`, so remove `env_key` when adding `auth`. This is [OpenAI's command-backed gateway auth](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/connect-to-a-gateway), verified with Codex CLI 0.160.0

## Model metadata for custom aliases

Codex looks up the selected model name in its bundled catalog to set the context window, reasoning levels, and tool support. A LiteLLM `model_name` Codex does not know, such as a custom alias, still works, but Codex logs `Unknown model <name> is used. This will use fallback model metadata.` and runs with generic defaults

Run `codex debug models` to print the bundled catalog. Copy the entry for the model your alias routes to, set its `slug` to the LiteLLM `model_name`, and save it as `{"models": [ ... ]}`. Put `model_catalog_json` before the first TOML table in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
model = "my-gpt-alias"
model_provider = "litellm"
model_catalog_json = "/absolute/path/to/litellm-models.json"
```

Keep `base_instructions` in the copied entry. Codex refuses to load an entry with neither `base_instructions` nor `model_messages.instructions_template`; the parse error starts with `Error: failed to parse model_catalog_json path` and reports that the model is missing both fields

The file replaces the bundled catalog. In testing, Codex logged the fallback warning for an internal model that was not in the file, so include every model name Codex will use by keeping the bundled entries and adding your aliases

Catalog entries come from the installed Codex version, so regenerate the file after upgrading Codex. [OpenAI's gateway guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/enterprise/connect-to-a-gateway) also says custom aliases need matching catalog metadata

## MCP setup

Register the LiteLLM MCP gateway as a streamable HTTP server in the same `~/.codex/config.toml`. Codex reads the bearer token from an environment variable rather than from the file, so reuse the one you already exported for the model provider:

```toml title="~/.codex/config.toml"
[mcp_servers.litellm]
url = "http://localhost:4000/my_mcp_server/mcp"
bearer_token_env_var = "LITELLM_API_KEY"
```

`my_mcp_server` must match a key under `mcp_servers:` in your gateway config, and the key needs access to that server (see [the overview](./overview.md#the-values-you-will-reuse-everywhere)). Codex sends the key as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, which the gateway accepts. Start `codex` and run `/mcp`: the server shows as `connected` with its tool count, and `/mcp verbose` lists the tools prefixed with the server name (`my_mcp_server-read_wiki_structure`) and `Auth: Bearer token`.

<Image img={require('../../../img/client_setup/codex_cli_mcp.png')} />

A literal `bearer_token = "..."` in the server block fails on current Codex with `bearer_token is not supported for streamable_http`; use `bearer_token_env_var`. If the server does not show up at all, you are on an older Codex build that ignores remote MCP servers unless `experimental_use_rmcp_client = true` is set under `[features]`; upgrade Codex instead.

For a LiteLLM server that fronts an upstream OAuth provider, run `codex mcp login litellm` to complete the flow instead of setting a static token; see [MCP OAuth](../../mcp_oauth.md).

## Troubleshooting

Connection refused means the gateway is not reachable at the `base_url` you set; check the host, port, and the `/v1` suffix. A 401 from the gateway means `LITELLM_API_KEY` is not exported in the shell you launch `codex` from, or the key is no longer valid. `Invalid model name passed in` means `model` does not match a `model_name` in your gateway config; use your name, not the upstream provider's. If requests never appear in the Admin UI you are still on the default provider, so confirm `model_provider = "litellm"` is set at the top level of the file. If the `/model` picker still shows only Codex's built-in models after [step 4](#model-catalog-and-service-tiers), the provider block is missing `model_catalog_url`, the `api_key_model_discovery` feature is off, or the gateway runs a release without the Codex catalog; a `curl` of `<LITELLM_PROXY_BASE_URL>/v1/models?client_version=0.159.3` with your key shows which side is at fault, since a gateway that supports the catalog answers with a top-level `models` key instead of `data`

## Next steps

[Codex in ChatGPT Desktop](./codex_chatgpt_desktop.md) uses this same config file. See also [LiteLLM virtual keys](../virtual_keys.md) and the [MCP gateway reference](../../mcp.md).
