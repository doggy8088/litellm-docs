This release is published as [`ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:v1.103.3`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pkgs/container/litellm). See the [GitHub release](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases/tag/v1.103.3) and the full [releases page](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases)

:::danger Breaking Changes

**The proxy exits when database setup fails at startup** instead of serving against an outdated schema. Set `ENFORCE_PRISMA_MIGRATION_CHECK=false` to keep the old behavior. See [PR #44205](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44205)

:::

:::warning Upgrading from `v1.102.x` or earlier

The two `LiteLLM_SpendLogs` index migrations from `v1.103.0` are now no-ops. Build the indexes online yourself, outside a transaction:

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS "LiteLLM_SpendLogs_api_key_startTime_idx" ON "LiteLLM_SpendLogs"("api_key", "startTime");
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS "LiteLLM_SpendLogs_litellm_call_id_idx" ON "LiteLLM_SpendLogs"("litellm_call_id");
```

:::

`v1.103.3` is a patch release on top of [`v1.103.2`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/releases/tag/v1.103.2). Startup exits on database setup failure, the `LiteLLM_SpendLogs` index migrations no longer build anything, streamed requests through an alias are billed correctly, and the base image and several dependencies are bumped. The `v1.103.3` tag points at [`ecae261`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/commit/ecae261b100cdf6bcb1d024ae69e4efa4a891be0)

## Bug fixes

Streamed chat completions through a dotted alias like `claude-opus-4.6` recorded $0 spend, because pricing looked up the alias instead of the deployment's model. Streamed requests are now priced from the deployment's model, the same way as non-streamed ones, and logged streamed responses still show the alias. An alias that points at a deployment with no pricing now records $0 on streamed requests too, matching the non-streamed behavior. See [PR #44341](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44341)

Chat replies bridged from the Responses API put the tool calls in a separate `choices[1]`, so apps that read only `choices[0]` never ran the tool. `choices[0]` now carries both the text and the tool calls with `finish_reason: "tool_calls"`. See [PR #44346](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/pull/44346)
