We're focusing LiteLLM on being the most reliable LLM gateway in production. As part of that, we're retiring a set of older features and integrations that few teams use and that we can no longer maintain to the standard you expect. Removing them keeps the core of LiteLLM stable and performant.

These features are targeted for removal in the release on **August 25, 2026**, roughly 60 days from now. If you don't use any of them, nothing changes and you can stop reading. If you do, the full [Deprecations migration guide](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/deprecations) walks through each one; most paths are a one-line config change.

This list is not final. If you depend on something here and want it to stay, reach out with the feature and your use case.

## Dashboard features going away

| Feature | Why it's going | What to use instead |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Learning Resources | Low usage | None |
| MCP Network Settings + "Internal network only" flag | TBD | TBD |

<!-- TODO: confirm MCP Network Settings scope and replacement before publishing -->

## Integrations and backends going away

| Feature | Why it's going | What to use instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GreenScale logging | Low usage; can't maintain to standard | None |
| DynamoDB as a proxy database | Can't maintain to our reliability bar as a proxy database | PostgreSQL |
| Gradient AI provider | Upstream service was discontinued | None |

## Packaging change

We're consolidating the PyPI and Docker packages down to a single `litellm` package. The extra variants (`litellm-database`, `litellm-ee`, `litellm-dev`, `litellm-non_root`) are going away. The `litellm` package will be the only supported package going forward and will absorb the functionality from `litellm-database` and `litellm-non_root`.

## What you need to do

If you use any of the above, follow the [Deprecations migration guide](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/deprecations). Most paths are a one-line config change. If you're unsure whether you're affected, reach out and we'll check for you.

<!-- TODO: add the canonical feedback channel (email / GitHub discussion / Slack) once confirmed. -->

Thanks for building on LiteLLM.
