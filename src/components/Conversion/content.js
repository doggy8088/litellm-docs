2. Install litellm with the project's own tool (uv add litellm, poetry add litellm, or pin it in requirements.txt).
3. Replace direct OpenAI or Anthropic client calls with litellm.completion or litellm.acompletion, keeping the same model with a provider prefix (openai/..., anthropic/...). LiteLLM returns the OpenAI response shape, so update any Anthropic-style parsing to choices[0].message.content. Keep streaming and tool calls working.
