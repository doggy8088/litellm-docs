# Model Management

When `STORE_MODEL_IN_DB` is on, your models live in the database rather than in a static `config.yaml`. That means day-2 changes happen right in the Admin UI: adding a model, editing pricing, rotating a provider key, or retiring a deployment, all with no config edits and no proxy restart.

This page covers those ongoing operations. If you are adding your very first model, start with the [Docker Quickstart](./docker_quick_start.md), which walks you through startup, provider connection, and your first request. Come back here once the gateway is running and you want to manage the models you have.

## The model list

Go to **Models + Endpoints** and open the **All Models** tab to see every model the gateway currently serves. Each row shows the public model name, the underlying provider and litellm model, and the input and output cost per token that LiteLLM maps automatically from its [model cost map](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/model_prices_and_context_window.json).

A badge on each model tells you where it came from: models added through the UI or API carry a database badge, while models loaded from `config.yaml` are marked as config. This distinction matters because config models cannot be edited from the UI (see [Database vs config.yaml models](#database-vs-configyaml-models) below). Use the search box and the provider filters to narrow a long list down to the models you care about.

## Inspect and edit a model

Click a Model ID in the list to open its detail page. The **Overview** tab summarizes the model's settings and provider, and the **Raw JSON** tab shows the full stored definition, useful when you want to confirm exactly what the gateway is holding.

Click **Edit Settings** to change the model in place. You can update the public model name that clients call, the litellm model name that requests are routed to, and the input and output cost per 1M tokens when you want to override the mapped pricing. Save, and the change takes effect immediately for new requests.

Two more actions live on this page. **Test Connection** re-verifies the model against the provider using its stored credentials, so you can confirm a key still works or that a newly edited setting is valid before clients hit it. **Delete Model** removes the model from the gateway; for database models this deletes the stored definition outright.

## Reusable provider credentials

Most deployments have several models behind the same provider account. Rather than paste the same API key into every model, create a named credential once and reuse it.

Open the **LLM Credentials** tab and click **Add Credential**. Pick your provider, enter the API key, and give the credential a name. The fields adapt to the provider you choose, so selecting Vertex AI, for example, gives you `Vertex Project`, `Vertex Location`, and `Vertex Credentials` instead of a single key field.

Once saved, the credential is available wherever you add or edit a model. In the Add Model form, choose it from the **Existing Credentials** dropdown instead of typing a key. From a model's detail page you can also go the other way with the **Re-use Credentials** button, which turns the credentials of a model you already configured into a named credential for future models. Models attached to a named credential are tagged `Credential: <name>` in the Usage page, so you can filter spend by credential without any extra setup; see [Credential Usage Tracking](./credential_usage_tracking.md).

## Database vs config.yaml models

Storing models in the database is what makes UI-driven management possible. Turn it on by setting `STORE_MODEL_IN_DB="True"` as an environment variable, or `general_settings.store_model_in_db: true` in your config. You can also toggle it at runtime from the **Models + Endpoints** settings in the UI, which is handy for cloud deployments where editing the config means a full release; the UI value overrides the config value.

With it enabled, every model you add through the UI or the API persists in the database and survives restarts and additional proxy instances. Provider credentials for those models are encrypted at rest using `LITELLM_SALT_KEY` (falling back to `LITELLM_MASTER_KEY` if the salt key is not set); keep that value secret and never change it once models exist, since credentials encrypted with the old value cannot be decrypted with a new one.

Database storage does not replace your `config.yaml`. Any models defined there keep working and show up alongside your database models. The one difference is that config models are owned by the file, so they cannot be edited or deleted from the UI; change them in the config and reload. For the config format itself, see [Config.yaml](./configs.md).

## Automation (API)

The same operations are available over HTTP, which is what you want for CI/CD or scripting bulk changes. These endpoints require `store_model_in_db` to be enabled; with it off, `POST /model/new` fails because there is nowhere to persist the model.

Add a model:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://0.0.0.0:4000/model/new" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $LITELLM_MASTER_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "model_name": "azure-gpt-4o",
      "litellm_params": {
        "model": "azure/gpt-4o",
        "api_key": "os.environ/AZURE_API_KEY",
        "api_base": "https://my-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
      }
    }'
```

The rest of the operations:

| Operation | Route | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List models | `GET /model/info` | Returns the full model list with API keys masked |
| Update a model | `POST /model/update` | Change `litellm_params` or `model_info` for an existing model |
| Delete a model | `POST /model/delete` | Body `{"id": "<model_id>"}`, admin only. This is a POST; there is no DELETE-verb route |

You can attach arbitrary `model_info` fields when you create or update a model, and they pass straight through to `GET /model/info` alongside the mapped cost and context data. That is the mechanism for annotating models with your own metadata, such as an owning team, a description, or a version, and reading it back programmatically.
