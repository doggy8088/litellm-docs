# Production Best Practices

Work through this page before going live. It covers the production configuration, machine sizing and worker strategy, Redis, and database and migrations; each section stands alone, so you can also use it as a review checklist for an existing deployment. For deeper container tuning such as alternative servers, TLS at the proxy, keepalive, and loading config from object storage, see [Server Tuning](./server_tuning.md).

## Configuration

### Set a master key

The master key is the proxy admin credential: it authenticates admin API calls and is the Admin UI login password. Set it as an env var (it must start with `sk-`), keep it in your secret manager, and rotate it with the [master key rotation flow](./master_key_rotations.md).

```bash
export LITELLM_MASTER_KEY="sk-<long-random-value>"
```

### Turn on alerting

Get notified about LLM exceptions, slow or hanging requests, budget crossings, database exceptions, outages, and weekly spend reports. In the Admin UI go to **Settings** then **Logging & Alerts**, open the **Alerting Types** tab, toggle the alert types you want, paste your Slack webhook URL, and click **Test Alerts** to confirm delivery. Thresholds and report frequency live in the **Alerting Settings** tab next to it.

<Image img={require('../../img/ui_alerting_types.png')} alt="Alerting Types tab in the Admin UI with per-alert toggles and Slack webhook fields" />

To bake it into config instead, set `alerting: ["slack"]` under `general_settings` and export `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` in the environment.

### Batch spend writes

Write spend updates to the database every 60 seconds instead of on every request; at production traffic, per-request writes become a database hot spot.

```yaml
general_settings:
  proxy_batch_write_at: 60
```

Above roughly 1000 requests per second, also route these writes through Redis with the [Redis transaction buffer](./db_deadlocks.md) to prevent connection exhaustion and deadlocks.

### Bound database connections

Cap the connection pool per worker process so your instances cannot exhaust the database. Size it as `MAX_DB_CONNECTIONS / (instances × workers)`; the default is 10.

```yaml
general_settings:
  database_connection_pool_limit: 10
```

:::warning Multiple instances

Each instance multiplies your total connections: 3 instances × 4 workers × 10 connections = 120 total connections against your database.

:::

### Keep error logs out of the database

LLM exceptions are written to the database by default. Under sustained provider errors this bloats the spend logs table; send exceptions to your logging stack (see [alerting](#turn-on-alerting) and [logging callbacks](./logging.md)) instead.

```yaml
general_settings:
  disable_error_logs: True
```

### Set a request timeout

Fail requests that hang instead of holding connections open; the default is 6000 seconds.

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  request_timeout: 600
```

### Production logging

Switch off debug logging, emit JSON logs, and silence FastAPI's per-request info logs:

```yaml
litellm_settings:
  set_verbose: False
  json_logs: true
```

```bash
export LITELLM_LOG="ERROR"
```

### Disable load_dotenv

Set `export LITELLM_MODE="PRODUCTION"`. This disables `load_dotenv()`, which would otherwise automatically load credentials from a local `.env`.

### Set the salt key

If you use the database, set a salt key for encrypting and decrypting stored variables. Do not change it after adding a model; it encrypts your LLM API key credentials, and changing it makes them unreadable. Use a [password generator](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to get a random hash.

```bash
export LITELLM_SALT_KEY="sk-1234"
```

[**See Code**](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/036a6821d588bd36d170713dcf5a72791a694178/litellm/proxy/common_utils/encrypt_decrypt_utils.py#L15)

## Sizing and workers

### Machine specifications

For optimal performance in production, we recommend the following resource configuration.

**1. Memory `requests` and `limits`**

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "1" # should be 1*num_workers
    memory: "4Gi" # should be 4*num_workers
  limits:
    cpu: "1"
    memory: "4Gi"
```

**2. HPA thresholds**

```yaml
targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 60
targetMemoryUtilizationPercentage: 80
```

### Workers and scaling

Run one Uvicorn worker per pod and scale horizontally (more pods) rather than vertically (more workers per pod). This is the default, so you only need `--num_workers 1`; one process per pod keeps latency predictable, lets the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler use the [thresholds above](#machine-specifications) accurately, and makes rolling restarts hitless because Kubernetes drains one pod at a time.

```shell
CMD ["--port", "4000", "--config", "./proxy_server_config.yaml", "--num_workers", "1"]
```

If you see gradual memory growth under sustained load, recycle each worker after a fixed number of requests with `--max_requests_before_restart` to bound memory usage.

```shell
CMD ["--port", "4000", "--config", "./proxy_server_config.yaml", "--num_workers", "1", "--max_requests_before_restart", "10000"]
```

For packing multiple workers into one container, alternative servers (Gunicorn, Hypercorn, Granian), staggering recycles with jitter, hitless rolling restarts on Kubernetes, terminating TLS at the proxy, keepalive tuning, and loading `config.yaml` from S3 or GCS, see [Server Tuning](./server_tuning.md).

## Redis

Run Redis (7.0 or newer) as soon as you run more than one proxy instance. It shares rate limit counters, router state, and the response cache across instances; without it, each instance enforces limits independently and cache hits stay local to the instance that served the request.

```yaml
router_settings:
  routing_strategy: simple-shuffle # (default) - recommended for best performance
  redis_host: os.environ/REDIS_HOST
  redis_port: os.environ/REDIS_PORT
  redis_password: os.environ/REDIS_PASSWORD

litellm_settings:
  cache: True
  cache_params:
    type: redis
    host: os.environ/REDIS_HOST
    port: os.environ/REDIS_PORT
    password: os.environ/REDIS_PASSWORD
```

Keep the default `simple-shuffle` routing strategy for high-traffic deployments; usage-based routing adds Redis lookups to the request path.

## Database and migrations

### Gracefully handle DB unavailability

When running LiteLLM on a VPC (and inaccessible from the public internet), you can enable graceful degradation so that request processing continues even if the database is temporarily unavailable.

**WARNING: Only do this if you're running LiteLLM on VPC, that cannot be accessed from the public internet.**

```yaml showLineNumbers title="litellm config.yaml"
general_settings:
  allow_requests_on_db_unavailable: True
```

When `allow_requests_on_db_unavailable` is set to `true`, LiteLLM will handle errors as follows:

| Type of Error | Expected Behavior | Details |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Prisma Errors | Request will be allowed | Covers issues like DB connection resets or rejections from the DB via Prisma, the ORM used by LiteLLM. |
| Httpx Errors | Request will be allowed | Occurs when the database is unreachable, allowing the request to proceed despite the DB outage. |
| Pod Startup Behavior | Pods start regardless | LiteLLM Pods will start even if the database is down or unreachable, ensuring higher uptime guarantees for deployments. |
| Health/Readiness Check | Always returns 200 OK | The /health/readiness endpoint returns a 200 OK status to ensure that pods remain operational even when the database is unavailable. |
| LiteLLM Budget Errors or Model Errors | Request will be blocked | Triggered when the DB is reachable but the authentication token is invalid, lacks access, or exceeds budget limits. |

[More information about what the Database is used for here](db_info)

### Run migrations from the Helm PreSync hook

:::info
The Helm PreSync hook flow is in beta.
:::

To ensure only one service manages database migrations, use our [Helm PreSync hook for Database Migrations](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/main/deploy/charts/litellm-helm/templates/migrations-job.yaml). This ensures migrations are handled during `helm upgrade` or `helm install`, while LiteLLM pods explicitly disable migrations.

1. **Helm PreSync Hook**:
   - The Helm PreSync hook is configured in the chart to run database migrations during deployments.
   - The hook always sets `DISABLE_SCHEMA_UPDATE=false`, ensuring migrations are executed reliably.

  Reference Settings to set on ArgoCD for `values.yaml`

  ```yaml
  db:
    useExisting: true # use existing Postgres DB
    url: postgresql://ishaanjaffer0324:... # url of existing Postgres DB
  ```

2. **LiteLLM Pods**:
   - Set `DISABLE_SCHEMA_UPDATE=true` in LiteLLM pod configurations to prevent them from running migrations.

   Example configuration for LiteLLM pod:
   ```yaml
   env:
     - name: DISABLE_SCHEMA_UPDATE
       value: "true"
   ```

### Use prisma migrate deploy

Use this to handle db migrations across LiteLLM versions in production:

```bash
USE_PRISMA_MIGRATE="True"
```

The migrate deploy command:

- **Does not** issue a warning if an already applied migration is missing from migration history
- **Does not** detect drift (production database schema differs from migration history end state - for example, due to a hotfix)
- **Does not** reset the database or generate artifacts (such as Prisma Client)
- **Does not** rely on a shadow database

How LiteLLM ships migrations:

1. A new migration file is written to our `litellm-proxy-extras` package. [See all](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/tree/main/litellm-proxy-extras/litellm_proxy_extras/migrations)

2. The core litellm pip package is bumped to point to the new `litellm-proxy-extras` package. This ensures, older versions of LiteLLM will continue to use the old migrations. [See code](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/52b35cd8093b9ad833987b24f494586a1e923209/pyproject.toml#L58)

3. When you upgrade to a new version of LiteLLM, the migration file is applied to the database. [See code](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm/blob/52b35cd8093b9ad833987b24f494586a1e923209/litellm-proxy-extras/litellm_proxy_extras/utils.py#L42)

### Read-only file system

Running LiteLLM with `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` is a Kubernetes security best practice that prevents container processes from writing to the root filesystem. LiteLLM fully supports this configuration.

If you see a `Permission denied` error, it means the LiteLLM pod is running with a read-only file system. LiteLLM needs writable directories for:
- **Database migrations**: Set `LITELLM_MIGRATION_DIR="/path/to/writable/directory"`
- **Admin UI**: Set `LITELLM_UI_PATH="/path/to/writable/directory"`
- **UI assets/logos**: Set `LITELLM_ASSETS_PATH="/path/to/writable/directory"`

**Option 1: Using EmptyDir Volumes with InitContainer (Recommended)**

This approach copies the pre-built UI from the Docker image to writable emptyDir volumes at pod startup.

        - name: migrations
          emptyDir:
            sizeLimit: 64Mi
```

</details>

**Option 2: Without UI (API-only deployment)**

If you don't need the admin UI, you can run with minimal configuration:

```yaml
env:
  - name: LITELLM_NON_ROOT
    value: "true"
  - name: LITELLM_MIGRATION_DIR
    value: "/app/migrations"
securityContext:
  readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

The proxy will log a warning about the UI but API endpoints will work normally.

Environment variables for read-only filesystems:

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `LITELLM_UI_PATH` | Admin UI directory | `/var/lib/litellm/ui` (Docker) |
| `LITELLM_ASSETS_PATH` | UI assets/logos | `/var/lib/litellm/assets` (Docker) |
| `LITELLM_MIGRATION_DIR` | Database migrations | Package directory |
| `PRISMA_BINARY_CACHE_DIR` | Prisma binary cache | System default |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME` | General cache directory | System default |

Notes: always set `LITELLM_MIGRATION_DIR` to a writable emptyDir path, and set `PRISMA_BINARY_CACHE_DIR` and `XDG_CACHE_HOME` to writable paths. If using a custom `server_root_path`, you must pre-process UI files in your Dockerfile as the proxy cannot modify files at runtime with a read-only filesystem. The UI is automatically detected as pre-restructured if it contains a `.litellm_ui_ready` marker file (created by the official Docker images).

## Verify production readiness

### Expected performance

See benchmarks [here](../benchmarks#performance-metrics).

### Confirm debug logging is off

You should only see the following level of details in logs on the proxy server:

```shell
# INFO:     192.168.2.205:11774 - "POST /chat/completions HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
# INFO:     192.168.2.205:34717 - "POST /chat/completions HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
# INFO:     192.168.2.205:29734 - "POST /chat/completions HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

## Deployment FAQ

**Q: Is Postgres the only supported database, or do you support other ones (like Mongo)?**

A: We explored MySQL but that was hard to maintain and led to bugs for customers. Currently, PostgreSQL is our primary supported database for production deployments.

Because LiteLLM talks to the database through Prisma over the PostgreSQL wire protocol, any Postgres-wire-compatible distributed SQL database works as a drop-in replacement. [YugabyteDB](https://www.yugabyte.com/) is used in production this way; point `DATABASE_URL` at its YSQL endpoint (`postgresql://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<dbname>`) and LiteLLM runs its migrations and queries unchanged. This is a good fit if you need horizontal scale or multi-region high availability beyond what a single Postgres instance provides.

**Q: If there is Postgres downtime, how does LiteLLM react? Does it fail-open or is there API downtime?**

A: You can gracefully handle DB unavailability if it's on your VPC; see [Gracefully handle DB unavailability](#gracefully-handle-db-unavailability) above.
